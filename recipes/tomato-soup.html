    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      There's nothing like a homemade soup that's been made using the fresh 
      vegetables grown from your backyard garden. Whether you're looking 
      for a soup your mom used to make, you're feeling under the weather, 
      or you simply enjoy the taste of tomatoes, we have it all right here.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 cups of chopped fresh tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 sliced onion</li>
      <li>4 whole cloves of garlic</li>
      <li>2 cups of chicken broth</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons of butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons of white sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

      <li>
        In a stockpot, over medium heat, combine the tomatoes, onion, 
        cloves and chicken broth. Bring to a boil, and gently boil for 
        about 20 minutes to blend all of the flavors. Remove from heat 
        and run the mixture through a food mill into a large bowl, or 
        pan. Discard any stuff left over in the food mill.

        In the now empty stockpot, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir 
        in the flour to make a roux, cooking until the roux is a medium 
        brown. Gradually whisk in a bit of the tomato mixture, so that no 
        lumps form, then stir in the rest. Season with sugar and salt, 
        and adjust to taste.
