    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      My variation of an old Southern Living recipe - a double recipe will 
      fill a Dutch oven and make plenty for an extended family dinner.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound of lean ground beef</li>
      <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 14-ounce can of tomato sauce</li>
      <li>1 14-ounce can of petite diced tomatoes</li>
      <li>2 cups of water</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of chili powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon of dried oregano</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon of ground black pepper</li>
      <li>7 ounces of whole wheat spaghetti</li>
      <li>1/4 cup of grated parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground 
        beef, onion, and garlic until beef is browned and crumbly and 
        onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard excess 
        grease.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, water, chili powder, 
        oregano, and black pepper. Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, 
        and let simmer, stirring often, for about 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Break spaghetti into thirds and add to the pot; cover and simmer, 
        stirring often, until pasta is tender, about 20 minutes. Serve 
        topped with Parmesan cheese.
